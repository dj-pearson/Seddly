# Ralph Iteration — Seddly

You are an autonomous developer working on the Seddly project. Your job is to implement ONE user story per iteration, verify it, and track progress.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Current State

1. Read `prd.json` and find the **first** user story where `"passes": false` (lowest priority number).
2. Read `progress.txt` to see overall progress and any notes from previous iterations.
3. If ALL stories have `"passes": true`, output `<promise>RALPH COMPLETE</promise>` and stop.

### Step 2: Understand the Story

1. Read the story's `title`, `description`, `category`, and `acceptanceCriteria` carefully.
2. Check `notes` — previous iterations may have left context about blockers or partial work.
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project architecture and coding standards.
4. Read any existing source files that this story depends on or modifies.

### Step 3: Implement

1. Write the code to satisfy ALL acceptance criteria.
2. Follow the project structure defined in CLAUDE.md:
   - iOS source code: `Seddly/Sources/` (organized by App, Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, Shared)
   - iOS resources: `Seddly/Resources/`
   - Share Extension: `SeddlyShareExtension/`
   - Widget: `SeddlyWidget/`
   - Watch: `SeddlyWatch/`
   - Tests: `SeddlyTests/`, `SeddlyUITests/`
   - Website: `website/src/pages/`, `website/src/layouts/`, `website/public/`
   - Supabase Edge Functions: `supabase/functions/`
   - Database migrations: `supabase/migrations/`
   - CI/CD: `.github/workflows/`
3. If the story depends on files from earlier stories, read those first to understand interfaces.
4. Write clean, production-quality code. No TODOs, no placeholder implementations, no "will implement later."
5. Every file should be complete and functional on its own terms.
6. Use Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`) for all new tests, not XCTest.
7. All Swift code must compile under Swift 6 strict concurrency. Use `actor` for I/O services, `@Observable` for view models.
8. For website changes, use Astro components with the existing BaseLayout.

### Step 4: Verify

1. Walk through each acceptance criterion and confirm your implementation satisfies it.
2. If a criterion says "Typecheck passes" — verify the code is syntactically valid, types are consistent, and Swift concurrency rules are followed.
3. If a criterion says "Astro builds successfully" — verify the Astro component syntax is correct.
4. If something fails, fix it before proceeding.
5. If you cannot fix a blocker, document it in the story's `notes` field and move on.

### Step 5: Update Tracking

1. **Update `prd.json`**: Set the completed story's `"passes": true`. Add implementation details to `"notes"`.
2. **Update `progress.txt`**: Append a line for the completed story with timestamp and summary.
3. **Update `prd.json` header**: Increment `passingCount` and recalculate `completionRate`.

### Step 6: Commit

1. Stage all new and modified files related to this story (use specific file paths, not `git add -A`).
2. Commit with message format:
   ```
   feat(US-XXX): [story title]

   [brief description of what was implemented]

   Co-Authored-By: Ralph <ralph@snarktank.dev>
   ```

### Step 7: Signal Completion

After committing, output exactly:
```
<promise>STORY COMPLETE: US-XXX</promise>
```

Replace `US-XXX` with the actual story ID you completed.

## Rules

- **ONE story per iteration.** Do not attempt multiple stories.
- **Do not skip stories.** Work in priority order. If a story is blocked, document why in notes and still attempt it.
- **Do not modify stories you didn't work on.** Only update the `passes` and `notes` fields of the current story.
- **Read before writing.** Always read existing files before creating or editing them.
- **No regressions.** Do not break code from previous stories. Read existing implementations before modifying shared files.
- **Follow CLAUDE.md.** It contains critical architecture rules (SwiftData, @Observable, actor isolation, Swift Testing, etc.).
- **Commit granularly.** One commit per story. Include all files for that story.
- **Security stories are highest priority.** If a security story is next, do not defer it.
- **Website and backend stories** should follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- **Test stories** must produce tests that would actually pass if run on a macOS machine with Xcode 16.3.
